Trolley problem:


The trolley problem is a series of thought experiments in ethics and psychology, 
involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number.
The series usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide 
with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can 
intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track.
