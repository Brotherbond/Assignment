Ideas to consider when completing this task:• Apply various algorithms to the problem. Caution: Use a small number ratherthan many, analyse in depth rather than being superficial and repetitive.• Is there a way of visualising the model(s)?• How will you assess the effectiveness of the model(s)?• Include as many features as you can. Does the model improve?• Compare the models produced.• How could you make further improvements?• What can you conclude about your model?• How strong is the relationship between the predictor and target variables?Clustering:Cluster analysis, or clustering, is an unsupervised machine learning task.It involves automatically discovering natural grouping in data. Unlike supervised learning (like predictive modeling), clustering algorithms only interpret the input data and find natural groups or clusters in feature space.Clustering techniques apply when there is no class to be predicted but rather when the instances are to be divided into natural groups.
