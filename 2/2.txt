Ideas to consider when completing this task:• Is there a way of visualising the clusters?• Can you make any conclusions about the clustering?• Include as many features as you can. Does the clustering change?• What advice would you give, in the context of the data, based on the clustering?Clustering:Cluster analysis, or clustering, is an unsupervised machine learning approach that tends to group input data based on observed properties or features into natural group. Cluster:A cluster may then be referred to an area with density of a particular feature or group of properties with data points closer to a central point than those in other clusterClustering Algorithms:clustering algorithms use similarity or distance measures between data points in the feature space in an attempt to show regions with dense observations; data scaling is often used to ensure data points are spread around a central point with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.For the purpose of this analysis K-means, a popular algorithm will be used
